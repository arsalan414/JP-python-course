# saylani-python-course

Hello and welcome to the repository.


This repository contains the python code and has the solutions of the assignments given in saylani python course.I have wrote the solution in jupytor notebook which we have used during the course,so if anyone want to use the code I recommend him/her to use jupytor notebook. 

This is open source and all are allowed to use my code, no need to ask for the permission. 
It's my humble request to please pull the code instead of copying it.
